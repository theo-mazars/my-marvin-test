# My Marvin Test

`my_marvin` is an Epitech project which consists of creating a testing environment with Jenkins.

## What will you find in this repository ?

This repo contains only a very basic "epitech like" project with a makefile that compiles a main with the basic rules:
- `all`
- `clean`
- `fclean`
- `test`
- `re`

## Usage

```
https://github.com/theo-mazars/my-marvin-test # github link for the "clone-repository" job
```

```
theo-mazars/my-marvin-test # github repo name for the "SEED" job
```

## Be careful

The packages `make` and `gcc` are not installed by default on the Jenkins Docker image as well as the `criterion` library

Your tests should fail if you try to build them without editing the image configuration
